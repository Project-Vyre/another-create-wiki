Kinetic Blocks are all about relaying Rotational Force elsewhere. 

They are the foundation of many contraptions, with some of them[^1] having the ability to step up or step down RPM[^2].

[^1]: A `Large Cogwheel` can be used to step up the RPM when connecting to a small `Cogwheel`. Other later stage options include the `Adjustable Chain Gearshift` and `Rotation Speed Controller` for continous motion adjustment. For **short bursts** of adjustment, the `Sequenced Gearshift` can be used but it does not permit continous motion and requires redstone to function.
[^2]: RPM is a measurement of speed. Rotations Per Minute.
