# Ponder Index
The built in tutorial system in Create. Use it and learn!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Ponder is the built in tutorial system and shows miniature scenes that are fully animated and have multiple timestamps.

{: .important}
I am not responsible for your negligence if you just skip over everything in the Ponder scene and don't indulge in the information.
PLEASE take a look around your screen, there are very useful buttons that very clearly state their function in a tooltip when hovered.

If you look at the bottom of your screen, you can see a row of buttons to help navigate the interface. You can also select the small lines on the playback bar and click and hold to pause or simply click to jump to that timestamp.

Not all Ponder scenes are done in a single scene, some have additional chapters when you reach the end of the Ponder scene.

## Keybinds

- `Q` is the default key to **pause** the Ponder scene and allows you to identify blocks used in the Ponder scene when you hover your cursor on them.
- `A` is the default key to **go back** to the previous Ponder scene. Only applicable if an entry has multiple Ponder scenes.
- `D` is the default key to **go to the next** Ponder scene. Only applicable if an entry has multiple Ponder scenes.
- `S` is the default key to **replay** the Ponder scene.
- `E` is the default key to **close** the Ponder scene.
