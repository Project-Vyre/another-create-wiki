# Another Create Wiki

The unofficial but simpler Create Wiki.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

{: .note}
This wiki is not finished and is a work in progress.

This website is made using Jekyll + GitHub Pages.
It is much lighter to load on your web browser and also mobile friendly.

Everything Create related can be found in the Ponder Index page, with an easy navigation tree.

## About
Create is a Minecraft mod created by **simibubi** *and* his team that empowers the player with a variety of blocks, tools and contraptions while also providing an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere.

*The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible. With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.*

### Recommendations
Before installing the mod, it is highly recommended to install [Just Enough Items (JEI) by mezz](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) as the vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience fully. 

If you are an architect, decorator and / or builder, it is also recommended to use [ItemZoom by mezz](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/itemzoom) as it shows the item in full scale.

Also, don't forget to **Hold [W] to Ponder** as this can answer many of your questions.


### For Wiki Contributors
If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.
