# Base Create Materials

So, how do I get started? Any advice?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

{: .important}
The information below is only applicable to base Create by itself on Minecraft `1.18.2`, `1.19.2` and later. The information provided may *not* apply to modpacks or if you have paired it with other mods as they may have alternate means of acquiring brass or zinc.

Let's start with the four foundational materials of Create which are Andesite Alloy, Copper, Zinc and Brass. I hope you have [Just Enough Items (JEI) by mezz](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) installed.

### Andesite Alloy

Pre-Nether obtainable, infinitely renewable and able to be automated fully.
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }

Andesite Alloy is your first step in getting into Create as it is one of the most utilized materials. 

Just to give you the rundown...
- Andesite acquisition has become mandatory. Get lots of it!
- Iron is also needed. Get *a lot* more. Go wild! Go spelunking!
- **Never** use Zinc to make Andesite Alloy. Zinc is a non-renewable resource!

Making Andesite Alloy by hand is less efficient as it requires TWO Andesite and TWO Iron Nuggets to make just ONE Andesite Alloy.

Once you get the Mechanical Press, make the Mechanical Mixer and Basin as soon as possible. Andesite Alloy made with the Mechanical Mixer only requires 1x Andesite and 1x Iron Nugget to make 1x Andesite Alloy instead of 2x of each ingredient.

{: .note}
Crushing raw iron ore and then washing it will yield redstone as well, so it is recommended to save some raw iron ore on the side.

### Copper Ingots

Pre-Nether obtainable, renewable from Drowned.
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }

Copper has become *significantly* more valuable and is utilized for many fluid related things.

{: .note}
Save your raw copper ore to be processed with Crushing Wheels later on for maximum refinement.

### Zinc Ingots

Pre-Nether obtainable, non-renewable.
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }

Like the others, grab as much of it as possible! It is used to make brass ingots.

{: .note}
Pssst, Crushing Wheel refinement would like to speak to you.

### Brass Ingots

Post-Nether obtainable, non-renewable.
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }

Requires a heated Blaze Burner under a Basin with a Mechanical Mixer running at a minimum speed of 32 RPM.

## Secondary Create Materials
These are materials that are needed for later.

## Quartz
Post-Nether obtainable, infinitely renewable and able to be automated fully.

# Modified Create Material Acquisition

## Mystical Agriculture
If installed with Create, all materials are infinitely renewable. Have fun automating!

## Tinker's Construct
If installed with Create, it is no longer necessary to go to the Nether to acquire a `Blaze Burner`
