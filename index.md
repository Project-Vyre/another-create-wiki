It is much lighter to load on your web browser and also mobile friendly.

## About Create
Create is a Minecraft mod created by **simibubi** *and* his team that empowers the player with a variety of blocks, tools and contraptions while also providing an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. 

*The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible. With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.*

### Recommendations
Before installing the mod, it is highly recommended to install [Just Enough Items (JEI) by mezz](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) as the vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience fully. If you are an architect, decorator and / or builder, it is also recommended to use [ItemZoom by mezz](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/itemzoom) as it shows the item in full scale.

Also, don't forget to **Hold [W] to Ponder** as this can answer many of your questions.


### For Wiki Contributors

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.
