# Create Addons

{: .warning }
**WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR GRAPHICAL GLITCHES OR CRASHES IF YOU ARE USING OPTIFINE!** Instead, use Sodium + Iris Shaders if you are on Fabric. If you are on Forge, use Rubidium and Oculus.

Here's a list of Create add-ons. Just check the compatibility list below. 

If you are also having issues with the add-ons crashing the game, please ensure that they are first compatible with Create 0.5.0 / Create 0.5.1 if you are playing from an older Minecraft instance. 
- If you wish to stay on Create 0.5.0 patch I, then download the mod files that were uploaded BEFORE May 22, 2023. 
- Anything past May 22, 2023 is **very likely** to have been updated for compatibility with Create 0.5.1.

**Read the developer's changelog on their mod page.**
