This is an unofficial Create Wiki made using Jekyll + GitHub Pages.

It is much lighter to load on your web browser and also mobile friendly.


### For Wiki Contributors

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

[^1]: [It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to the site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site).
